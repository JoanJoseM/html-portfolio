<p>I love Luvikka (Lovlolikka) also known as Coffee Plum, its very delicious. Salted luvikka is my favourite. But in my home there is no luvikka tree.</p>

<p>The fruits and leaves of Indian coffee plum are used against diarrhea. Dried leaves are reportedly effective for bronchitis and roots are said to supress toothache.</p>
